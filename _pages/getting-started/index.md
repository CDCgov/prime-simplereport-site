Before you can use SimpleReport, you’ll need to set it up.

If you’re conducting COVID-19 tests and want an easier way to report results, find out [how to sign up]({% link _pages/getting-started/organizations-and-testing-facilities/onboard-your-organization.md %}).

If you’re a public health department, learn [about ReportStream]({% link _pages/getting-started/public-health-departments/about-prime-reportstream.md %}).
