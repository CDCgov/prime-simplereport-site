Public health departments receive SimpleReport testing data via ReportStream (previously known as the PRIME Data Hub). ReportStream is CDC’s free interoperable platform that aggregates and securely delivers public health data from organizations and testing facilities directly to public health entities.

There are three main reasons for public health departments to use ReportStream:
- **You’ll receive data from SimpleReport.** If your jurisdiction wants to receive test results from SimpleReport, you’ll need to build an integration with ReportStream.
- **You’ll have to support fewer connections.** ReportStream’s model focuses on aggregating data from multiple sources and senders, which you’ll receive together in a single feed.
- **You’ll get more complete, timely data.** ReportStream validates data from its senders and transfers it to you at your preferred frequency and in your preferred format.

To have testing facilities in your jurisdiction send you data through SimpleReport, you need to connect to ReportStream. Learn more on the [ReportStream website](https://reportstream.cdc.gov/).
