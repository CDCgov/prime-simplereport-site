Once you’ve activated your account, you can log in and start using SimpleReport.

To log in:
1. Go to SimpleReport.gov and click **Log in** at the top right corner of the page.
![The SimpleReport homepage with "Log in" button shown]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/step-1.png %})
2. Enter your username and password.
3. You’ll need to use the multi-factor authentication option that you set up when you registered your account. Here’s an example of what you’ll need to do if you set up SMS authentication:
   1. Click the gray **Send code** button to have the verification code sent to your phone. (Make sure to click the button, or else the code won’t get sent.)
   ![Okta page with "Send code" button shown]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/sms-step-1.png %}){: .maxw-card-lg }
   1. Once you receive the text, enter the code in the “Enter Code” field.
   ![Okta page with the "Enter code" field shown]({% link assets/img/resources/log-in-to-simplereport/sms-step-2.png %}){: .maxw-card-lg }
   1. Click **Verify**.
   {: .list--alpha }
4. If your organization has multiple testing facilities, select yours from the choices shown.

Once you’ve successfully logged in, you can do a number of tasks, like [conduct a test]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/index.md %}) or [add a new person to SimpleReport]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/manage-people-you-test/add-a-new-person.md %}).
