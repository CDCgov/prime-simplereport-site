SimpleReport submits results to public health departments for a variety of diagnostic tests — also known as test devices, test kits, or just tests. We include all devices from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) list of COVID-19 and multiplex ({{diseases | strip}}) diagnostic tests available in the U.S.

Don’t see the test device you’re using? [Your organization administrator can update your facility settings](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/manage-facility-info/update-facility-settings) by adding a new test device, or by deleting any you aren’t using anymore. If you’re an admin and don’t see the one you're using in your facility settings, [contact support](https://www.simplereport.gov/contact-us).
