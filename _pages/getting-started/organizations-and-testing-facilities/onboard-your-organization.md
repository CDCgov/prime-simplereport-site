If you’re doing COVID-19 rapid testing, the first step is to request an account for your organization so you can start using SimpleReport. 

Organizations are companies, institutions, school systems, and more that have multiple testing facilities as part of their network. For example, John Doe School District is the “organization” that includes Highland High School, Middleton Middle School, etc. Each individual school is considered a “testing facility” that must be connected to its parent organization in SimpleReport. If you don’t have a parent organization that’s ok —  you’ll just enter in your information a bit differently when you fill out our form.

Only one person from an organization needs to request access to SimpleReport. This person —  called the account administrator — can add individual testing facilities after creating the organization account.

Let’s get started.

  <div class="usa-checkbox">
    <input class="usa-checkbox__input" id="access" type="checkbox" name="access" value="access">

    <label class="usa-checkbox__label" for="training">(optional) Get training</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>

## Request access for your organization
To get access, fill out the [SimpleReport organization access request form]({% link pages/forms/account-request-form.html %}).

Make sure that the organization name that you enter in the form is accurate, since this is the name that SimpleReport will share with your public health department.

## Verify your identity
Once you’ve filled out the organization access request form, your administrator will schedule a short video call with a representative from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). You’ll be asked to show two forms of ID to verify your identity and get access to SimpleReport. (In addition to this list of [identification you can use](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/120-acceptable-documents-for-verifying-employment-authorization-and-identity), we will also accept a work ID.)
