If you’re doing COVID-19 rapid testing, the first step is to request an account for your organization so you can start using SimpleReport.

Organizations are companies, institutions, school systems, and more that have multiple testing facilities as part of their network. For example, John Doe School District is the “organization” that includes Highland High School, Middleton Middle School, etc. Each individual school is considered a “testing facility” that must be connected to its parent organization in SimpleReport. If you don’t have a parent organization that’s ok —  you’ll just enter in your information a bit differently when you fill out our form.

Only one person from an organization needs to request access to SimpleReport. This person —  called the account administrator — can add individual testing facilities after creating the organization account.

Let’s get started.

## Onboarding checklist
Organization administrators need to complete a few steps to request access for your organization and sign up for a SimpleReport account. After that, you can learn more about how to use SimpleReport.

## Fill out your organization information
To sign up and get access, fill out the [SimpleReport organization access request form](/app/sign-up).

Make sure the organization name that you enter in the form is accurate, since this is the name that SimpleReport will share with your public health department.

## Enter your personal contact details
As the organization administrator, you'll provide your personal contact information to help verify your identity.

## Verify your identity
You'll answer identity verification questions with our verification partner, Experian. This takes just a few minutes and doesn’t impact your credit score. 

If Experian is unable to verify your identity, you’ll need to schedule a separate video call. During the call, you’ll be asked to show two forms of ID to verify your identity. We recommend a driver's licence and a work ID, or you can use any of the [documents on this list](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/120-acceptable-documents-for-verifying-employment-authorization-and-identity).

Your SimpleReport account will be accessible after your identity is verified. You’ll simply activate and log in to your account.
