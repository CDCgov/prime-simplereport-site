Organization admins can reset multi-factor authentication (MFA) login access settings for staff or employees (users) in SimpleReport. If you don’t have admin privileges, talk to an admin about upgrading permissions on your account.

To reset a user MFA:

1. Click the gear icon at the top right corner of the page.
2. Find and click “Manage users”.
3. Select **Reset MFA**, then confirm.
