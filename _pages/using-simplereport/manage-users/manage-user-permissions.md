You might want to limit which members of your staff can perform certain tasks or access certain information in SimpleReport. All users can conduct and report tests, but you can restrict access to other things, like viewing and correcting results, viewing and editing profiles, and accessing testing facility settings.

To manage user permissions in SimpleReport, you must have admin privileges. If you don't have admin privileges, talk to an admin about upgrading permissions on your account.

To change permissions for a user:
1. Click the gear icon at the top right corner of the page
![SimpleReport's top navigation, with the gear icon on the far right side selected]({% link assets/img/resources/manage-user-permissions/step-1.png %})
2. Beneath the SimpleReport logo at the top of the page, find the "Manage users" tab. Click "Facility access" below.
3. Under “User role”, click the user whose access you want to edit.<br>
  There are three levels of access: “Admin”, “Standard”, and “Testing only”:
  - **Admin** users have full access to conduct and report tests, manage test results, manage patient profiles, and manage testing facility and user (staff) settings.
  - **Standard** users can conduct and report tests, manage test results, and manage patient profiles. They can’t manage testing facility or user (staff) settings.
  - **Testing only** users can only conduct and report tests.
4. Select the access level that you want to grant for this user, then click **Save changes**.
![The three levels of access described above ("Admin", "Standard", and "Testing only")]({% link assets/img/resources/set-user-permissions.jpg %})

The next time this user logs in to SimpleReport, they’ll have the level of access that you just set.
