5. New users will automatically be assigned the "Standard" access level, which allows them to conduct tests and manage test results and patient profiles. Once you send the invite, you can change the user’s access level by following the instructions to [manage user permissions]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/manage-users/manage-user-permissions.md %}).
