If you work at multiple testing facilities or locations, you’ll be asked which facility you’re working at that day each time you log in to SimpleReport. Just choose the facility where you’re working, and you’ll be ready to [conduct tests]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/index.md %}).

You might have already chosen a testing facility, and need to change it. To switch between testing facilities after you’ve already chosen one:
1. At the top right corner of the page, just to the left of the gear and person icons, find the name of your current testing facility. Click it to reveal a dropdown menu of other facilities.
