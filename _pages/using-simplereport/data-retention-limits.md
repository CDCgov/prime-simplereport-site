Beginning November 1st, 2025, SimpleReport will only store patient data for 30 days to ensure enhanced patient privacy. This means that SimpleReport will only store patient profiles and test results for 30 days. After 30 days, this data will be deleted. 
The new data retention limits will affect how some facilities use SimpleReport. 

## Here’s how different facilities can prepare for the new data retention limits. 

**If your facility uses SimpleReport as an internal record-keeping tool:**

1. **Explore new tools to store test results and patient profiles.** If you need to access test results or patient profiles from longer than 30 days ago, you will need to find a new tool. 

2. **Download data for your records.** If your facility needs to store historical patient information, we’ve made it easy to download your data. Visit the <u>Patients</u> page to download patient profiles and the <u>Results</u> page to download test results.  

**If your facility frequently retests the same patients:**

1. **Inform your staff that their workflow may change.** Since patient profiles and test results cannot be stored in SimpleReport longer than 30 days, your team will need to re-enter every patient who hasn’t been tested in the last 30 days before submitting test results. 

2. **Download patient profiles for your records.** If your facility needs to store historical patient information, we’ve made it easy to download your data. Visit the <u>Patients</u> page to download patient profiles and the <u>Results</u> page to download test results.  

**If your facility mostly tests different patients or uses the bulk upload feature:**

1. **Your workflow will remain the same.** We don’t expect your team to be impacted by the change. 

2. **Download patient profiles for your records.** If your facility needs to store historical patient information, we’ve made it easy to download your data. Visit the <u>Patients</u> page to download patient profiles and the <u>Results</u> page to download test results.
