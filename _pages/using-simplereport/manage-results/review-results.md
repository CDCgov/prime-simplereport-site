If you work for a testing facility, here's how to find your patient's COVID-19 results:
1. Click Results at the top of the page.
![SimpleReport's top navigation, with the "Results" tab selected]({% link assets/img/resources/review-results/step-1.png %})
2. A table of results from your testing facility will appear showing all results from the past 48 hours. To show older results, you can always click the blue **See all results** button at the bottom of the page.

If there’s a problem with any result, you can [mark it as an error]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/manage-results/correct-a-previous-test-result.md %}).
