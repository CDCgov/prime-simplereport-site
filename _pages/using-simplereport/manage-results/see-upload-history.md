When you report your results by [uploading a spreadsheet to SimpleReport]({% link _pages/using-simplereport/report-test-results/bulk-upload-results.md %}), individual results do not appear in the **Results** page. Instead, you can find general information about the spreadsheet in the **Upload history** tab:   
1. Click **Results** at the top of the page.

2. Go to **View upload history** underneath the main navigation bar.

3. In a table, you’ll see information spreadsheets previously submitted at your organization. Information includes the unique report ID the system assigns to a CSV when it’s uploaded; the date and time it was submitted; and the number of records — or test results — included in the spreadsheet.
