After you’ve added someone in SimpleReport, you may need to return and update their information, including adding or modifying the testing facilities where they'll be tested.

To update someone's profile:

1. Click **People** at the top of the page.
![The SimpleReport site with the "People" tab chosen in the top navigation]({% link assets/img/resources/update-someones-profile/step-1.png %})
2. Click on the name of the person whose profile you want to update.
![The mouse hovering over someone's name on the SimpleReport "Page" page]({% link assets/img/resources/update-someones-profile/step-2.png %})
3. A page with all of the person’s information will appear. Add or edit whichever information you need to update.
4. Click the blue **Save changes** button at either the top right or bottom left of the page. (The button will be gray until you’ve made a change.)

You’ll be sent back to the “People” page, and a green box will appear at the bottom of the page to confirm that SimpleReport has saved your update. You’re all done.
