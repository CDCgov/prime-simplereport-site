The fastest way to get new people into SimpleReport and start conducting tests is through patient self-registration. Only new patients need to self-register.

To offer self-registration to your patients:

1. Go to the gear icon, then click on the **Patient self-registration** page on SimpleReport. Use the **Organization link** if you want the patient to be able to get tested at any of your locations, or use the relevant **Testing facility** link if they will only be tested at one location. ![The SimpleReport app with self-registration page shown]({% link assets/img/resources/self%20reg.png %})
2. Send the link to new patients before their test via email, text message, mail, etc. You can also give out the link in person at your testing facility using a sign or printed form with a QR code, for example.
3. Patients complete the self-registration form online, at their convenience.
4. When they arrive for testing, simply search for patients by name in SimpleReport and follow your normal process to check them in.
