Archiving a patient removes them from your list of patients. Because it's archived and not deleted, their record will still be accessible if it needs to be recovered later. (To unarchive a patient, youâ€™ll need to [contact SimpleReport support]({% link pages/contact-us.html %}).)

To archive a patient:

1. Click **Patient** at the top of the page. ![SimpleReport's top navigation, with the "People" tab selected]({% link assets/img/resources/add-a-new-person/patient-navigation.png %})
2. Go to the **Actions** column.
3. Click on the three dots next to the patient you want to archive, then click **Archive record**.
4. Confirm archive request.
