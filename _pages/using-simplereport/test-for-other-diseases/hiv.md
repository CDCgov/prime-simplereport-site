We currently have the **INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test** and **OraQuick In-Home HIV Test** rapid tests already available and can support other tests as well. If you have a test you’d like to use in SimpleReport, email us at <a href="mailto:support@simplereport.gov">support@simplereport.gov</a> with a link to the clinical details page for that device and we’ll add it for you.
