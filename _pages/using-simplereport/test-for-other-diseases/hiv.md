You can report HIV results through the [conduct tests workflow](/using-simplereport/report-test-results/conduct-and-submit-tests/) by using the INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test and OraQuick In-Home HIV Test rapid tests. 

SimpleReport can also support other tests. If you have a test you’d like to use in SimpleReport, email us at [support@simplereport.gov](mailto:support@simplereport.gov) with a link to the clinical details page for that device and we’ll add it for you.
