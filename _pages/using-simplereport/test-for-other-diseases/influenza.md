## Recording results
Certain devices test for COVID-19, influenza A, and influenza B (“multiplex devices”). SimpleReport requires you to include flu results when you record tests from these devices. **At this time, flu results are not sent to public health departments other than the California Department of Public Health (CDPH)**, but you can share them with patients.

To record flu results on SimpleReport, [conduct and submit a test](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/) as you normally would. You’ll be able to enter results for flu A and flu B, along with COVID-19, when you select a multiplex device. 

## Reporting results
Organizations sending results to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) can use [SimpleReport's bulk uploader](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/report-test-results/bulk-upload-results/) to report positive flu tests. Report COVID-19, flu A, and flu B results all from a single spreadsheet. [See more information and guidance about reporting flu results](https://www.simplereport.gov/assets/resources/bulk_results_upload_guide-flu_pilot.pdf). 

CDPH senders can also conduct and submit a flu test using one of the eight devices listed below, along with all multiplex devices. If you use another device to test for flu, please send information about it to support@simplereport.gov. 
- Abbott ID NOW Influenza A & B 2 Test
- Abbott BinaxNOW Influenza A & B Card 2 and DIGIVAL
- bioMerieux bioNexia Influenza A+B test
- DiaSorin Simplexa Flu A/B & RSV
- Quidel Lyra Influenza A+B
- Quidel Solana Influenza A+B
- Quidel Sofia Influenza A + B FIA
- Quidel QuickVue Influenza A + B

Flu reporting will be available in other jurisdictions soon.
