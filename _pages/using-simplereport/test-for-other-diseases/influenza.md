Certain devices test for COVID-19, influenza A, and influenza B (“multiplex devices”). SimpleReport requires you to include flu results when you record tests from these devices. Flu results are not sent to public health departments at this time, but you can share them with patients. 

To record flu results on SimpleReport, [conduct and submit a test](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/) as you normally would. You’ll be able to enter results for flu A and flu B, along with COVID-19, when you select a multiplex device. 

Devices that test for flu and COVID-19 include: 

- CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Assay (RT-PCR)
- Abbott Alinity M (RT-PCR)
- BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 & Flu A+B (Antigen)
- Quidel Sofia 2 (Antigen)
