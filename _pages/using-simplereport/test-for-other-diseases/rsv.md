## Recording results
Certain devices test for COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (called “multiplex”  or “panel” tests). When you use these devices to conduct tests, SimpleReport requires you to include RSV results. **At this time, RSV results are not sent to public health departments other than the California Department of Public Health (CDPH)**, but you can share them with patients.

To record RSV results on SimpleReport, [conduct and submit a test](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/) as you normally would. You’ll be able to enter results for RSV, along with flu and COVID-19, when you select a multiplex device. 

## Reporting results
Organizations sending results to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) can use [SimpleReport's bulk uploader](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/report-test-results/bulk-upload-results/) to report positive RSV tests. Report COVID-19, flu, and RSV results all from a single spreadsheet. [See more information and guidance about reporting flu results](https://www.simplereport.gov/assets/resources/bulk_results_upload_guide-flu_pilot.pdf). 

CDPH senders can also conduct and submit an RSV test using one of the TBD devices listed below, along with all multiplex devices. If you use another device to test for RSV, please send information about it to [support@simplereport.gov](mailto:support@simplereport.gov).

RSV reporting will be available in other jurisdictions soon.
