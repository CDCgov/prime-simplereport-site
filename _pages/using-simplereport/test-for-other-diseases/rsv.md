## Recording results
Certain devices test for COVID-19, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (called “multiplex”  or “panel” tests). When you use these devices to conduct tests, SimpleReport requires you to include RSV results. **At this time, you can share RSV results with patients, but they will not be reported to public health departments**, other than the ones in states listed below. 

To record RSV results on SimpleReport, [conduct and submit a test](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/) as you normally would. You’ll be able to enter results for RSV, along with flu and COVID-19, when you select a multiplex device. 

## Reporting results
Organizations can use SimpleReport to report positive RSV results to the following state health departments:

You can report COVID-19, flu, and RSV results all from a single spreadsheet using [SimpleReport's bulk uploader](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/report-test-results/bulk-upload-results/). [See more information and guidance about reporting flu results](https://www.simplereport.gov/assets/resources/bulk_results_upload_guide-flu_pilot.pdf). 

You can also report RSV results through the [conduct tests workflow](https://www.simplereport.gov/using-simplereport/conduct-and-submit-tests/) by using any multiplex device (also known as a "panel test"). If you use an RSV-only testing device, please send information about it to [support@simplereport.gov](mailto:support@simplereport.gov). 

RSV reporting will be available in other jurisdictions soon.
