## SimpleReport

SimpleReport is a free tool that makes it easy for COVID-19 testing sites to record results for rapid point-of-care tests and quickly report required data to public health departments. It was built by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in partnership with the U.S. Digital Service (USDS).

## CDC

CDC works 24/7 to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S. Whether diseases start at home or abroad, are chronic or acute, curable or preventable, human error or deliberate attack, CDC fights disease and supports communities and citizens to do the same.

CDC increases the health security of our nation. As the nation’s health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats. To accomplish our mission, CDC conducts critical science and provides health information that protects our nation against expensive and dangerous health threats, and responds when these arise.
