## SimpleReport Terms of Service
As a User accessing or using SimpleReport (Application) provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in a CDC cloud environment (“CDC Platform”), you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for and shall abide by these Terms of Service, as well as any relevant sections of [CDC’s Privacy Policies](https://www.cdc.gov/other/information.html) (collectively, Terms).

### Scope
SimpleReport is a free tool that makes it easy for facilities such as health care settings or schools to record and quickly transmit public health data to public health departments. It also allows those facilities to enable individuals or guardians to access relevant test results. This Application is being provided by HHS and CDC to enable an Entity to record its data intake workflow, for record keeping needs and to transmit relevant and necessary data to state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authorities (STLT Public Health Agencies) in furtherance of public health surveillance and response activities. It also allows the Entity to designate certain users of the data, as set out in these Terms. The Application through which the Entity and any users interact with relevant public health data is subject to these Terms. Use of the Application constitutes acceptance of these Terms.


### Definitions
- **Entity**: A health care provider or facility; testing site; a state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authority (STLT Public Health Agency); or other organization that is enrolled in and using Simple Report to record and/or transmit data. 

- **User**: An individual whose personal data is being reported via Simple Report (Individual User), or an individual authorized to act on behalf of the Entity under these Terms (Entity User or Entity Administrator). Simple Report will only designate one User from the Entity as the Entity Administrator. Entity Administrators will have more detailed identity verification than general Entity Users. Once the Entity Administrator has their identity verified, the Entity Administrator can add other general Entity Users or Individual Users to the Application. All roles are referred to as “User” for the purposes of these Terms, unless otherwise indicated.

### Data Rights and Usage
#### Accounts/Registration

##### For entity users
If you are using the Application on behalf of an Entity as either an Entity Administrator or Entity User, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that Entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that Entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer to you and that Entity). 

In order to access the Application, as part of the registration process for the Application, and for your continued use of the Application, you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details). Any such information you give to CDC or HHS must be accurate and up-to-date. You must inform us promptly of any updates by updating your information in the Application or by emailing [support@simplereport.gov](support@simplereport.gov) so that we can keep you informed of any changes to the Application or these Terms which may impact your usage of the Application. We may use the contact information you provide to contact you regarding usability research for ongoing product and service improvement. Upon Entity registration and the creation of Entity User accounts within the Application, credentials (such as passwords, keys, tokens, and Entity and Entity User identifications (IDs)) will be issued to you by HHS or CDC. These credentials are intended to be used only by you and to identify any software or APIs which you are using. You agree to keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other persons from using your credentials.

##### For entity administrators
The Entity Administrator agrees to verify the identity of other Entity Users who are added and to inactivate any other Entity Users who should no longer have access. The Administrator also agrees to set permissions appropriately to determine the minimum access necessary for each other Entity User to complete their required job duties.

##### For individual users
Entity Administrators will grant Individual Users access to the Application. Individual Users can use the Application to access and review their own information or information about others as may be permitted by applicable law (e.g., on behalf of a minor or otherwise as a guardian). As noted above, all Users agree to accept and comply with these Terms once you register and use the Application.

#### Privacy
You may use the Application to search, display, analyze, retrieve, view and/or otherwise ‘get’ information from data you are sending (or for Individual Users, for data being sent about you) via the Application and the Platform. Please note that the data which you are recording, transmitting or accessing via the Application may be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and other laws, and requires special safeguarding. By accessing and using the Application, you agree to strictly abide by all applicable federal and state laws regarding the collection, use, protection and disclosure of information obtained or sent through the Application. Where Individual Users may be accessing the information on behalf of a minor or otherwise as a guardian, Entity Users and Administrator Users agree to assume full responsibility for designating the correct Individual User contact information within the Application, in accordance with applicable law. If you would like more information about the application of the Privacy Act at CDC, [visit the Health and Human Services website](https://www.hhs.gov/foia/privacy/index.html).

For purposes of use of this Application, if you are a HIPAA-covered entity or acting on behalf of one as a business associate or if the data is maintained by you in a HIPAA-covered designated record set, you further acknowledge that you will abide by applicable HIPAA regulations (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164) for purposes of appropriate storage, transmission, use and disclosure of any protected health information


#### Use of Data
This Application is being provided in order to allow for the recording of Entity data, support Entity’s workflow, for record keeping purposes, and for transmitting relevant data to STLT Public Health Agencies in furtherance of public health surveillance and response activities. HHS and CDC acknowledge that though CDC is providing the Platform, CDC does not intend to access the data nor does it intend to review or analyze this data. As such, CDC does not intend to take custody or control of data sent via the Application. Entity and Individual Users acknowledge and agree that CDC and Administrative Users may manage the data sent via the Application for purposes of operating the CDC Platform (which includes verifying user identity) and transmitting to and facilitating use by STLT Public Health Agencies of such data. Except as may be required by applicable federal law, CDC may not release the data sent via the Application for other purposes than described below. 

#### Sharing of Data
Data recorded and stored in the Application by the Entity is for use by the Entity as needed for workflow, record keeping, and reporting purposes. Data recorded and stored by the Entity in the Application will be automatically transmitted  to the appropriate STLT Public Health Agency based on both the Entity ZIP code and the Patient’s ZIP code, including, for coronavirus disease 2019 test results, all relevant fields as defined in the [HHS COVID-19 Laboratory Reporting Requirements](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-laboratory-data-reporting-guidance.pdf). By entering results that are being transmitted to the relevant STLT Public Health Agency or Agencies, the Entity attests that it is authorized to report the data via the Application. Though CDC will not actively access and obtain data from the Application, Entity, directly or in coordination with the relevant STLT Public Health Agency, may decide to use the Application to send deidentified or other as may be determined by Entity, to CDC; such data sent to CDC will be maintained consistent with applicable federal laws.

You may petition CDC to regain access to the Application through the support email address provided by CDC for the Application. If CDC determines in its sole discretion that the circumstances which led to the refusal to provide the Application or terminate access to the Application no longer exist, then CDC may restore your access. All provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive termination, shall survive termination including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
